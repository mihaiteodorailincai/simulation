15-MINUTE CITY DELIVERY SYSTEM - ANALYSIS RESULTS
================================================

MARKET ANALYSIS:
• Target: Moderate-scale pilot deployment
• Daily volume: 550 packages (proof-of-concept scale)
• Market penetration: 1.5% of Eindhoven delivery market
• Service area: 3 key neighborhoods (Centrum, Blixembosch, Meerhoven)

OPTIMAL FLEET CONFIGURATION:
• Total robots needed: 8
• Total bikes needed: 3
• Distribution: 3 robots + 1 bikes per hub
• Expected utilization: 96.2% robots, 86.6% bikes

PEAK DEMAND PATTERNS:
• Morning peak: 8-10 AM (1.8x normal demand)
• Lunch surge: 12-1 PM (1.6x normal demand)  
• Evening peak: 5-7 PM (1.5x normal demand)
• Off-peak reduction: 70% less demand during night hours

DELIVERY STRATEGY:
• Same-zone (robots): 70% of deliveries, <1km range
• Cross-zone (bikes): 20% of deliveries, 3-7km range
• External integration: 10% from distribution centers

SIMULATION PARAMETERS:
• Runtime: 840 steps (14 hours, 7 AM to 9 PM)
• Peak correlation: 0.881 (excellent pattern matching)
• Service coverage: 800m radius per hub
• Sustainable transport: 90% of deliveries via eco-friendly vehicles
